        On the advice of his brother, Van Gogh painted by himself and his first masterpiece, The Potato Eaters. <br>
        However, during this period, Van Gogh continued to express his opposition to the church, which adversely affected family relationships, <br>
        including his father, who was a pastor. After his father's sudden death, his family criticized Van Gogh, and Van Gogh was shocked and moved to Paris, <br>
        where his younger brother Theo resided. <br>

    After arriving in Arles, southern France, Van Gogh developed his own style while studying Dutch and Parisian and Japanese styles. <br>
    At this time, 'Yellow House' sets up an atelier and invites painters in the vicinity, but only 'Gauguin' responds to this invitation and moves to Arles. <br>
    Van Gogh was good at first, but then mentally exhausted from competition and strife. He is admitted to a mental hospital. After a few weeks, <br>
    he returns to the Yellow House, but under pressure from his neighbors, he is eventually admitted to a mental hospital in Saint-Remy.<br>
